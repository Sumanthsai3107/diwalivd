                <h2>Victory of Light over Darkness:</h2>
                Diwali symbolizes the triumph of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance.<br>
                <h2>Religious Significance:</h2> 
                The festival has various legends associated with it. In northern India, it marks the return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile and his victory over the demon king Ravana. In other regions, it is associated with the worship of Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and the legend of Lord Krishna defeating the demon Narakasura.
                Celebrations<br>
                <h2>Lighting Lamps and Diyas:</h2>People decorate their homes with oil lamps (diyas) and colorful rangoli (patterns made on the floor using colored powders or flowers) to welcome the deities.

                <h2> Puja (Prayers):</h2>Special prayers and rituals are performed, especially the Lakshmi Puja, to invoke the blessings of the goddess for wealth and prosperity.
                    <h2>Feasting and Sweets:</h2> Diwali is a time for feasting on delicious foods and sweets. Families prepare a variety of traditional dishes and distribute sweets to friends and neighbors.

                                <h2>Duration</h2>
